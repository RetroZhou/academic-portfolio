<div class="home">

<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>
    
I currently hold a position as an Associate Professor at Macao Polytechnic University. I am also affiliated with SUNY Korea and Stony Brook University. Before joining MPU, I was an Assistant Professor at SUNY Korea and Northwest Missouri State University. Before that, I was a Roncesvalles Postdoc Researcher at the University of Guelph under the supervision of Joe Sawada and Aaron Williams.<br><br>

I received my PhD in computer science from the University of Guelph, under the supervision of Joe Sawada, and my undergraduate degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong under the supervision of Evangeline Young.<br><br>

My research focuses on combinatorics, string algorithms, Gray codes, de Bruijn sequences, graph theory, and design and analysis of algorithms. I am also interested in financial modeling, investing, and sports analytics lately. I maintain a list of my publications, research projects and implementations under the <a href="/academic-portfolio/research/">Research</a> tab.<br><br>

I am looking for students working under my supervision. If you are interested in my research, feel free to send me an email ðŸ™‚
